This repository if for practicing the Github Flow.
My name is Patrice Edwards, and I am a Professor of Physics with a strong background in teaching, research, and data-driven problem solving. Over the course of my academic career, I have developed expertise in analyzing complex systems, designing experiments, and interpreting large datasets to draw meaningful conclusions. I am now seeking to transition into the data science industry, where I can apply my analytical skills, quantitative training, and experience with statistical methods to real-world challenges. I bring a unique perspective as both an educator and researcher, with proven ability to communicate technical ideas clearly to diverse audiences. My goal is to contribute to data-driven decision making, develop practical solutions, and continue growing as a professional in the rapidly evolving field of data science.
